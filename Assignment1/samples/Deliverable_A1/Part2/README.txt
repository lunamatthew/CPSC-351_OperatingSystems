Description of Contribution: I did this assignment alone, and worked on and researched all the problems myself.
	All code and effort that went into this assignment was done by me alone. I really enjoyed working on this.
Statement: I, Matthew Luna, truthfully and faithfully completed this assignment using my own knowledge of these topics,
	what I have learned in class regarding these topics, and utilized the skeleton code provided where I saw fit.
	I researched the Linux manual of the system calls used being, wait(), fork(), execlp(), getpid(), getppid(), getgid(), and getuid().
	This was also my introduction into using, albeit lightly, .json files for the first time, and can see some very cool applications
	for using said files that I found doing this assignment and in my research for it.
Programming Language Used: C++
How to execute programs: Once both serial.cpp and parallel.cpp have been compiled, each program should run through the created executable just
	fine as any other program. For the functionality of each of the programs there should be a text file included inside the same directory
	as the executable code itself named "input.txt". This text file should include coordinates (latitude and longitude) seperated by white space
	between the two decimal numericals, and then seperated by new lines for new locations. This is EXACTLY how the "input.txt" file was provided
	for the assignment on Canvas as I have not edited the input file in any way. Assuming this format remains, any data should work for my 
	program, including more or less data as the program dynamically parses the data for fetching the weather information into the .json files.
	The .json files that will be saved should save into the same directory as the executable code and will be numerically organized as described
	in the assignment prompt. (i.e. file1.json, file2.json, etc etc) Each .json file represents the data fetched for one location, each .json
	file will be for a different location as originally provided for in the "input.txt" file.
 
	Run the executable, wait for the parent process to exit, and each .json will be inside the same directory. Each program works properly and 
	as expected for both executables following the prompt.
Extra Credit?: I did not implement the extra credit.
Additional Notes: No additional notes. Thank you for the very fun and interesting assignment!
